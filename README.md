## 1. Mobile Gestures Overview

Mobile gestures simulate user interactions on touch devices like smartphones and tablets. These interactions include:
- **Tap**: Quick touch, similar to a mouse click.
- **Long Press**: Touch and hold an element.
- **Swipe**: Move your finger across the screen to scroll or switch views.
- **Scroll**: Navigate content that extends beyond the screen's view.
- **Drag and Drop**: Move an object by dragging and releasing it.
- **Zoom In/Out**: Use two fingers to change zoom levels.
