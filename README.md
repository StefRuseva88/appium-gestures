## Overview
This repository provides a set of tests focused on automating common mobile gestures using **Appium** for mobile app testing, that includes gestures like taps, swipes, scrolls, drag-and-drop, and zoom using the **ApiDemos** app.

### Table of Contents:
- [Mobile Gestures Overview](#mobile-gestures-overview)
- [Scrolling](#scrolling)
- [Swiping](#swiping)
- [Drag and Drop](#drag-and-drop)
- [Sliding Seek Bar](#sliding-seek-bar)

- [Running the Tests](#running-the-tests)

### Prerequisites:
- Install Appium Server.
- Install Appium Inspector.
- **ApiDemos-debug.apk** file.
- Set up a virtual or real Android device for testing.
  
## Mobile Gestures Overview

Mobile gestures simulate user interactions on touch devices like smartphones and tablets. These interactions include:
- **Tap**: Quick touch, similar to a mouse click.
- **Long Press**: Touch and hold an element.
- **Swipe**: Move your finger across the screen to scroll or switch views.
- **Scroll**: Navigate content that extends beyond the screen's view.
- **Drag and Drop**: Move an object by dragging and releasing it.
- **Zoom In/Out**: Use two fingers to change zoom levels.

## Scrolling

### Test Objective:
- Automate scrolling actions using **Appium Inspector**.
- Write the **ScrollToText** method to scroll until the text **"Lists"** is found.
- Click on **Lists** and verify that **" Single choice list"** is displayed.

## Swiping

### Test Objective:
- Automate swipe gestures using **Appium Inspector**.
- Use Selenium's Actions class to simulate swiping.
- Click and hold on the first image, move by an offset, and release.
- Verify that the third image is visible.

## Drag and Drop

### Test Objective:

- Automate drag and drop gestures.
- Use **By.Id** to find the draggable and drop target elements.
- Use JavaScript actions to drag and drop the first red dot over the second one.
- Verify that the **"Dropped!"** message is displayed.

## Sliding Seek Bar

### Test Objective:
- Automate sliding actions for a seek bar.
- Use Appium Inspector's **Coordinates Mode** to get the precise sliding coordinates.
- Slide the seek bar to a specific value and assert the value is displayed.
- Write **MoveSeekBarWithInspectorCoordinates** method to slide the bar from the start to the end coordinates.
- Verify the displayed value matches the expected result.

## Zoom In/Out

### Test Objective:
- Automate zoom gestures using Appium Inspector.
- Use Appium Inspector to create a zoom-in gesture and execute it.
- Zoom out using similar steps.
- Use the saved gesture to zoom in and out at specific coordinates on the **WebView**.
